- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabrielifloss
- 👀 I’m interested in Jazz, Softwares and Physics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python and ABAP (in short).
- 🐠 This profile and my blog will serve as a method to store my studies throughout my career. At the moment I am a little bit busy with work and declaring taxes, so this is not being updated accordingly ;(
- 📫 You can send me an e-mail in gabrielifloss@hotmail.com and I'll certainly reply you as soon as I see it :)
